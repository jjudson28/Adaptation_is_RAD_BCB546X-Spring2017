## PCA Plot README
### Angela Bunning  

* If you want to recreate the first set of PCA plots in Funk *et al*, 2016 please refer to the R markdown file/R notebook that is in this repository. 

* It has all the Unix function and R code with annotations you will need to format the files properly and generate the PCA plots

* Happy plotting!
